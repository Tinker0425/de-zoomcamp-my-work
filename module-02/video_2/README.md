## Video 2 - 2.1.2 Learn Kestra

- My 2.1.2 gitbook notes [here](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/module-2/2.1-introduction-to-orchestration-and-kestra/2.1.2-learn-kestra)

But note, that this actual docker-compose file comes from
the docker compose kestra link in the gitbook that leads
to another video. The docker-compose yml code is also found
using that link
