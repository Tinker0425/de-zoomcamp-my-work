## Video 5 - 2.2.3 Transform Data with dbt and Postgres in Kestra

- My 2.2.3 gitbook notes [here](https://data-engineering-zoomcamp-2025-t.gitbook.io/tinker0425/module-2/2.2-etl-pipelines-in-kestra-detailed-walkthrough/2.2.3-transform-data-with-dbt-and-postgres-in-kestra)

I ran into issues here. I am using the updated docker-compose from Will
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/pull/628)
and the 03 flow provided, but I am getting errors, so moving on
